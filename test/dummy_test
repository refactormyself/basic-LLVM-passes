RUN: echo "just a dummy file - no language"
RUN: cat %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=MY_PREFIX
RUN: echo "COM: this is a Dragonfly" | FileCheck %s


COM: this is a FileCheck comment line. Dragonfly
COM: Normally all the lines in this file will be a comment of the file-type's language (e.g. c++, python, etc)

MY_PREFIX: this is not a comment, the second line of this file is test that this Prefix exists

COM: FileCheck always need a file input which specifies the pattern to match.
COM: The above is just a glimpse, notice that normally I would be piping a different file into it, like line 3
COM: Next we test a pattern to be matched. We are looking for a DragonFly (try the COM pattern with 'dragon', 'fly', a see magic)

CHECK: COM:
CHECK: Dragon
